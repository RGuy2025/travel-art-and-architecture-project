        <h3>Athenian Acropolis</h3>
        <h4>Ancient Citadel, Athens, Greece</h4>
        <p>The Acropolis of Athens, ancient citadel dedicated to the city’s patron goddess, Athena. Its existing
          buildings
          were primarily constructed in the second half of the 5th century bce. The complex is perhaps the best known of
          the
          ancient acropolises, which were central, defensively oriented districts in ancient Greek cities. Typically
          located on
          the cities’ highest ground, acropolises were home to the cities’ chief municipal and religious buildings. The
          Parthenon, a temple to Athena, is the crowning jewel of the acropolis of Athens and is considered to be the
          culmination of
          the development of the Doric architectural order.</p>

              I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills. I was
              inspired
              by my husband's love of art and architecture.</span>

          <h4>Relevance to Modern Day</h4>
          <p>The art and architecture of ancient civilizations are more than just remnants of the past— <span>they are
              vivid
              reflections of
              human creativity, belief systems, and societal structure.</span>
