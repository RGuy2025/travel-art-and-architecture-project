          <h3>Athenian Acropolis</h3>
          <h4>Ancient Citadel, Athens, Greece</h4>
          <p>The Acropolis of Athens, ancient citadel dedicated to the city’s patron goddess, Athena. Its existing
            buildings
            were primarily constructed in the second half of the 5th century bce. The complex is perhaps the best known
            of
            the
            ancient acropolises, which were central, defensively oriented districts in ancient Greek cities. Typically
            located on
            the cities’ highest ground, acropolises were home to the cities’ chief municipal and religious buildings.
            The
            Parthenon, a temple to Athena, is the crowning jewel of the acropolis of Athens and is considered to be the
            culmination of
            the development of the Doric architectural order.</p>

              <h4>Roman Colosseum</h4>
              <p>The Colosseum in Rome - it was the largest amphitheatre in the ancient world, and is still a prominent
                landmark in the
                Italian capital.
              </p>
              <h5>Located</h5>
              <p>Rome, Italy</p>
              <h5>Also known as</h5>
              <p>Flavian Amphitheatre</p>
              <h5>Built By</h5>
              <p>Construction of the Colosseum began under the Roman emperor Vespasian between 70 and 72 CE. The
                completed
                structure was
                dedicated in 80 CE by Titus, Vespasian’s son and successor. The Colosseum’s fourth story was added by
                the
                emperor
                Domitian in 82 CE. Importantly, the arena was paid for with plunder from Titus’s sack of Jerusalem in 70
                CE, and it was
                built by enslaved Jews from Judaea.</p>

              <p>The Louvre ceased to be a royal residence when Louis XIV moved his court to Versailles in 1682. The
                idea of using the
                Louvre as a public museum originated in the 18th century. Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billarderie, the
                comte
                d’Angiviller, who was the director of Louis XVI’s estates, helped build and plan the Grande Galerie,
                which today houses
                the museum’s collection of Italian paintings, and he continued to acquire major works of art.</p>
